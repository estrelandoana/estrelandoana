# About Me

</div>

✨🚀 Hello World, Meet the Unconventional Creator on a Mission! 🚀✨

👨‍💻 Human Coder | 💡 Design Virtuoso | 🌎 Global Citizen | 🚀 Aspiring Programming Intern

Welcome to my slice of the digital cosmos! At <a href="https://www.42network.org/campuses/42-sao-paulo/" rel="nofollow">42 São Paulo</a>, I'm not just learning to code; I'm becoming a <a href="https://www.humancoders.com.br" rel="nofollow">Human Coder</a> who understands that behind every pixel, there's a person, and behind every line of code, there's a story.

🎓 Wrapped in a tapestry of technical academia, from system development to graphic design, and web mastery to programming, I'm your all-in-one toolkit with a human touch, the Swiss Army knife in a world hungry for digital craftsmanship.

🖥️ With a degree in Graphic Design, I've harnessed the power to not only visualize but also materialize ideas that resonate with hearts and minds alike.

🇺🇸 My two-year tech pilgrimage across the United States has enriched me with a cultural lexicon that transcends code, equipping me with the versatility of a Global Human Coder.

🌐 From a pivotal role in a Chinese app revolution to aspiring for innovation on every screen, I’ve interfaced with technology across hemispheres.

🔍 Now, I’m on a quest for the holy grail of internships: a programming role where I can channel my electrifying blend of skills into creating code that doesn’t just function but fascinates, all while infusing human-centric logic into software solutions.

If you're scouting for a programming intern who personifies a blend of coding finesse, design intelligence, global perspective, and a heartbeat, let’s sync up! My mission is to embed the human experience into the binary world.

💌 Want to disrupt the digital norm? Let’s script the future together!
